The __contrib__ directory showcases use of various aurutils components, similar to the `EXAMPLES` section in `aur(1)`. Examples here do not necessarily fit into a single pipeline and are thus kept as separate programs.

To use a script with `aur(1)`, copy it to a directory in `PATH`. Alternatively, create a symbolic link if you have no local changes and always want to use the latest version.

```
$ cp -s /usr/share/aurutils/contrib/aur-vercmp-devel /usr/local/bin
$ aur vercmp-devel
```

You can build upon these scripts to fit your own workflow. For example, you can use `aur-vercmp-devel` to make a script that updates both regular and VCS packages:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# sync VCS packages that are outdated according to aur-vercmp-devel
# sync all packages that are outdated according to AurJson (--upgrades)
aur vercmp-devel "$@" | cut -d: -f1 | xargs -r aur sync --no-ver-shallow --upgrades "$@"
```
