.SH NAME
aurbuild \- build packages to a local repository

.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY aurbuild
.I \-d database
.OP \-cfNs
.OP \-a queue
.OP \-r root
.OP \--
.OP "makepkg args"
.YS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Build packages, adding the results to a local repository (usually
configured with a \fIfile://\fR prefix\fR in \fIpacman.conf\fR).

It is assumed that build directories are located in the current
directory, and described in a text file which is taken as argument.

.SH OPTIONS
All arguments after -- are passed to \fImakepkg\fR, or
\fIaurbuild_chroot\fR when \fI-c\fR is specified.

.B \-a
.RS
A text file with directories containing a PKGBUILD. If none is
specified, the current directory is assumed.
.RE

.B \-c
.RS
Build packages with \fIaurbuild_chroot(1)\fR.
.RE

.B \-d
.RS
The name of the pacman database.
.RE

.B \-f
.RS
Continue the build process if a package with the same name is found
(ignoring the extension). Existing packages will be moved with a
\fI~\fR suffix.
.RE

.B \-N
.RS
Do not sync the local repository after building.
.RE

.B \-r
.RS
The root for the repository. The \fBroot\fR is the location for the
pacman database (\fIfoo.db\fR), built packages, and secondary files such
as the files database (\fIfoo.files\fR). This defaults to the
\fIServer\fR value of the configured repository.
.RE

.B \-s
.RS
Sign built packages and the database with gpg.
.RE

.SH NOTES
When building locally (outside a container), \fIpacman -Syu \fR is run
while restricted to a local repository. This is comparable to
\fImakepkg -i\fR, but without subsequent package installation (if a
package was installed before, it is updated to the latest available
version). An interesting side-effect is that pacman considers packages
inside the official repositories "local", and warns if they are newer
than any custom counterpart. Packages which define a \fIreplaces\fR
field are ignored if the target package is installed on the local
system.

Databases are built with \fILANG=C\fR to avoid libalpm from skipping
entries if the locale is not set (FS#49342). Packages are signed
manually with \fIgpg --verbose --detach-sign --no-armor\fR (FS#49946).
