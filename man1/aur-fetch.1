.SH NOTES
.
.SS HISTORY REWRITES
.B aur\-fetch
will refuse to fetch rewritten history by default. This happens rarely,
as only Trusted Users have permissions to force-push to the AUR.
.PP
In those situations, something serious may have happened that may
require the user to do manual intervention on the machine.
To raise awareness to these events,
.B aur\-fetch
will refuse to fetch unless
.B \-\-force
is passed.
.
.
.SS LOGS
The logs shown by
.B aur\-fetch
show changes that happened since the commit referenced by the
special reference
.B AUR_SEEN
stored inside the repository.
.PP
This reference can be created with with:
.PP
.EX
    \fB$ aur fetch \-\-confirm\-seen \fI<package> \fR[\fP<package>...\fR]\fR
.EE
.PP
which will mark the current commit as seen, signaling
.B aur\-fetch
that current changes should not be shown in future logs.
.PP
When this reference is missing,
.B aur\-fetch
will consider the entire history as changes.
.
.
.SS LOCAL MODIFICATIONS (EXPERIMENTAL)
While
.B aur\-fetch
will try to preserve changes committed locally, by trying to reapply
them on top of the incoming new changes, it will discard any uncommitted
changes present in the repository.
.PP
If the changes cannot be applied cleanly,
.B aur\-fetch
will exit with error, leaving the repository files with conflict
markers for the user to resolve.
